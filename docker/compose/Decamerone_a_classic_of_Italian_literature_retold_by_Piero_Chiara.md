Boccaccio wrote it in the aftermath of the plague that devastated Europe in 1348, killing millions of people and changing the social and economic order. The stories reflect the hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows of the people who lived through those dramatic times, as well as their moral values, religious beliefs, and cultural traditions.
 
Piero Chiara was a novelist and journalist who was born in 1913 in Luino, a town on Lake Maggiore. He was one of the most prominent representatives of the so-called "neorealism", a literary movement that emerged after World War II and focused on the realistic depiction of the everyday life of ordinary people, especially in rural and provincial areas. Chiara was also known for his ironic and humorous style, his love for his native land, and his interest in history and folklore.
